			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hello, I'm Cory, a web developer looking to support my city by helping local businesses get online with affordable, user-friendly websites. Whether you're a barber, restaurant owner, thrift shop, or anything in between, I am dedicated to making your business visible.</p>

			<p>My dream has always been to help as many people as I can. From the beginning, I’ve known that the best way to do that is to scale upwards. A few years ago, even $500 or groceries for a month could have changed my life. All I needed was that step-up, and every time I thought I was going to fail, life would give me just a little push.</p>

			<p>Everybody who's been to downtown Fort Smith knows that we have challenges—homelessness, a drug problem, and sometimes, a lack of kindness. But most of all, life is hard.</p>

			<p>I always thought to myself: What if I could put myself in a position to change the lives of people on a larger scale? What if I could insert myself into a workforce where I could be truly valuable—where I could use my skills to grow my wealth, introduce kindness and charity, and support not just my immediate area, but an entire city?</p>

			<p>Let’s work together to make life a little better for everyone.</p>
